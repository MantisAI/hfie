# Contributing to hfie

Thanks for your interest to contribute to this tool üôè. Here we cover how you
can get started and some processes we follow.

## Code changes

If you are submitting a Pull Request (PR) based on an existing issue: please
carry on, otherwise please open an issue to discuss the change you want to
propose.

To setup your development environment follow the instructions in the README
in the 'for development' section. Note that we use `pre-commit` to enforce
style standards. Precommit runs checks at commit time, and may will prevent a
commit until its checks pass.

Before opening a PR please make sure all tests pass. You can find instructions
on how to run the tests in the README. Tests will also run automatically as
part of a Github action; if they fail, we will ask you to fix them before
continuing.

Please add a detailed description of the change you propose, and mention the
issues it relates to, ideally using `Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER` so that the issue is
closed automatically once the PR is merged.

Finally, please update the documentation in the README or in the module as
required for the new functionality or changes you are making.

## Issues and Feature Requests

If you are reporting a bug, please provide us with a way to reproduce the error.
This will make the process of fixing it much easier, otherwise it will be
difficult to be sure that any change we make is succcesfully addressing the
issue that you are experiencing.

Feature requests are welcome. Please describe the rationale behind the proposal
and how it affects your use case.
